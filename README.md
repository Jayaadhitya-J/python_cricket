Cricket database management system is a project that is a
model of a cricket database software .This software can be
accessed by the user as well the administrator.
Being a user, one can perform various actions , such as view all
the details of a player ,the details of a particular team ,the stats
of a player like the number of runs he scored ,wickets taken etc.
and the overall points table of the ongoing league. Whereas
being the administrator, one can control the database and
operations related to it, such as entering the player details
,adding new players or teams and updating existing records .
All the data provided by the administrator and the user will be
stored in the database, which can later be reviewed by them
when required.
The Cricket database Software is simple, and easy to use,
making the task of managing a league having hundreds of
players a lot less tedious than it usually is.
Python Integrated Development Environment has been used in
creating the project.
